Here is the description of the parameters âˆ’

socket_family: This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses). 

socket_type: This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.

protocol: This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.

The family of protocols that is used as the transport mechanism. These values are constants such as AF_INET, PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on.
type    The type of communications between the two endpoints, typically SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols and SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols.'''
